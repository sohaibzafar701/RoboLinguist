# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a scalable, open-source robotics fleet control system that enables natural language control of multiple robots using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system will demonstrate "ChatGPT for Robots" capabilities by allowing users to command robot fleets through conversational interfaces, with the LLM translating natural language into ROS2 commands for execution in simulated and real environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a robotics operator, I want to control multiple robots using natural language commands, so that I can manage complex robotic operations without needing to know specific ROS2 syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a natural language command THEN the system SHALL translate it to appropriate ROS2 actions
2. WHEN the system receives "move robot 3 to shelf A" THEN it SHALL generate the corresponding navigation command for robot 3
3. WHEN multiple robots are commanded simultaneously THEN the system SHALL distribute tasks appropriately across available robots
4. WHEN a command is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL request clarification or apply safe defaults

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to simulate and test robot fleet operations in a controlled environment, so that I can validate system behavior before real-world deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL spawn 3-5 TIAGo robots in a warehouse-like Gazebo environment
2. WHEN robots receive navigation commands THEN they SHALL move to specified locations using ROS2 navigation stack
3. WHEN the simulation runs THEN it SHALL provide real-time visualization of robot positions and status
4. WHEN testing scalability THEN the system SHALL support at least 10 robots simultaneously

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a fleet manager, I want the system to handle dynamic replanning and obstacle avoidance, so that operations can continue smoothly when unexpected situations arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an obstacle blocks a robot's path THEN the system SHALL automatically replan the route
2. WHEN replanning occurs THEN the system SHALL complete the new plan within 100ms
3. WHEN a robot encounters an error THEN the system SHALL reassign its task to another available robot
4. WHEN environmental conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt robot behaviors accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a safety officer, I want the system to implement safety protocols and reject unsafe commands, so that robot operations remain safe for humans and equipment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives an unsafe command THEN it SHALL reject the command and log the incident
2. WHEN an emergency stop is triggered THEN all robots SHALL immediately halt operations
3. WHEN safety protocols are tested THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 95% reliability in rejecting unsafe commands
4. WHEN ambiguous commands are received THEN the system SHALL default to safe operational parameters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate LLM services for command processing, so that the system can understand and process natural language inputs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to OpenRouter API
2. WHEN processing commands THEN the system SHALL use Mistral 7B or Llama 3 models
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits and failures gracefully
4. WHEN command accuracy is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve 99% success rate over 100 trials

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to provide performance metrics and logging, so that I can analyze system behavior and optimize operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL log completion times and success rates
2. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL track command accuracy, latency, and scalability metrics
3. WHEN system runs THEN it SHALL generate reports showing task completion statistics
4. WHEN benchmarking THEN the system SHALL measure and report replanning times under 100ms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an open-source contributor, I want to access and contribute to the project codebase, so that I can help improve and extend the system capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is published THEN it SHALL be available on GitHub with MIT license
2. WHEN users access the repository THEN they SHALL find comprehensive setup instructions and documentation
3. WHEN contributors want to help THEN they SHALL find clear contribution guidelines
4. WHEN the project launches THEN it SHALL include demo videos and interactive examples

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to interact with the robot fleet through a web interface, so that I can easily command robots without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the web interface THEN they SHALL see a natural language input box
2. WHEN commands are submitted THEN users SHALL see real-time feedback from the robot simulation
3. WHEN robots execute tasks THEN users SHALL see live visualization of robot movements
4. WHEN system responds THEN users SHALL see command execution logs and status updates

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want distributed task management capabilities, so that the system can scale to handle large robot fleets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL use Ray for distributed computing
2. WHEN tasks are assigned THEN the system SHALL dynamically distribute them across available robots
3. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL support at least 50 robots on cloud infrastructure
4. WHEN load balancing THEN the system SHALL optimize task distribution for efficiency
