# Contributing to RoboLinguist

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RoboLinguist! We welcome contributions from the robotics and AI community to help advance natural language interfaces for robot fleet management.

## üéØ **Project Vision**

RoboLinguist aims to democratize robot control by enabling natural language interaction with autonomous robot fleets. We're building a production-ready system that bridges the gap between human intuition and robotic precision.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS2 (helpful but not required)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RoboLinguist.git
   cd RoboLinguist
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python setup_config.py
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   python run_webots_demo.py  # Integration test
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow**

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for new features
- `feature/feature-name` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/issue-description` - Critical bug fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow our coding standards (see below)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   python -m pytest tests/

   # Run integration tests
   python run_webots_demo.py

   # Check code quality
   flake8 .
   black --check .
   ```

4. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use our PR template
   - Include clear description of changes
   - Reference related issues
   - Ensure all checks pass

## üìã **Contribution Guidelines**

### Code Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8, use Black formatter
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public functions/classes
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for better code clarity
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper exception handling
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate levels

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(safety): add collision avoidance system
fix(translator): resolve formation command parsing issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All new functions must have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Complex features need integration tests
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage
- **Safety Tests**: Critical safety features require comprehensive testing

### Documentation Standards
